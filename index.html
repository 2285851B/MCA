		<h2>Notating Musical Scores</h2>
		<p>Below are the notated scores I created for the my project, 
		I choose to create the score for the song <b>'The Unforgiven' by Metallica</b>,
		in addition to that, I also created edited versions of this score. All avaliable below.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Scores:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href='pages/the_unforgiven/the_unforgiven.html' class="listhead">The Unforgiven Standard Score</a>

		<h2>Basic Analytics</h2>
		<p>Next, I used the program jSymbolic to create analysis files of 'The Unforgiven'. I also used music21 in python to generate a piano roll 
			and a pitch histogram of 'The Unforgiven'.</p>

		<h2>Music as Sound</h2>
		<p>For this task I downloaded 3 copyright free songs of different genres, 
			I then identified and listed the most important metadata. Next I created
			a spectogram for each of these songs using  SonicVisualizer.

		<h4>Advantage of time-frequency analysis over waveform analysis</h4>
		<p>
			One of the advantages of time-frequency analysis over waveform-based analysis is that it 
			is possible for humans to see which notes are being played at which times. 
			In waveform-based analysis it is impossible for the human eye to view the wave, and to 
			know what note is being played at any given time. However, in a time-frequency analysis 
			it is possible to see which notes are present. An example of this is with the song 
			‘Good God’ which I created a spectrogram for, in the spectrogram there are a variety of 
			notes at different Hz visible, and we can even see at what times the song includes vocals.
