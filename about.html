            <h2>Identify and theme for your dataset</h2>
            <p>
                    As a theme for my dataset I will look at collecting information about Metallica discography. To do this I will first collect information about each 
                    of the albums, this includes, but is not limited to: album artwork (and alternative album artwork), band members on the album, total playtime, 
                    number of songs, etc.
                    <br>
                    I will also provide information about each of the songs individually. I will provide more metadata about the songs individual song play 
                    time and song name. After this, I will include a link to an audio track of the song, I will not host the audio file itself (due to copyright) 
                    but will link to another website hosting the track legally, this website will likely be using a popular and widely available file format such 
                    as mp3 or wav. I will also include the musical tablature for the songs whether this be a hyperlink to an external site, an image, or a PDF.

            <h3>Current manifestations of data about this theme</h3>
            <p>
                    Some of this information has been curated in online websites. For example, the website http://www.metstuff.com/ has an excellent collection 
                    of vinyl records and CD’s from Metallica. This website has curated much information about each of their objects such as the artwork, track 
                    listings, and playtime. However, something they have not done is include any audio of the tracks, neither have they included any information 
                    about the members who were currently in the band at the time of release.
                    <br>
                    Another website at http://www.metpage.org/ has a lot of the information under their ‘discography’ section. When viewing the albums in this
                     website they have a lot more information available, such as the album sales, band members, and song lyrics. However, this website does not 
                     seem to be complete as it is missing their most recent album. In addition to this, the formatting could be improved, for example the lyrics 
                     are all listed below the album information, this makes for a very long webpage and finding a certain song difficult. This could be improved 
                     by having the lyrics in separate tabs or with a hyperlinks.
